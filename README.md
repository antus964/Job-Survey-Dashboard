📊 Data Professional Survey Dashboard
🚀 Built using Power BI & Microsoft Excel

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes survey data from data professionals to uncover salary trends, job roles, and preferred programming languages. Using PowerQuery Editor, the raw dataset is cleaned and structured for effective visualization in Power BI.

🔍 Key Focus Areas:

✔️ Data cleaning & transformation using PowerQuery
✔️ Effective data visualization techniques
✔️ Extracting insights on salary trends, job roles & education

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

📊 Power BI – For interactive dashboard creation

🏗 Power Query Editor – For data transformation

📄 Microsoft Excel – Data preprocessing

⚡ Challenges Faced & Solutions

1️⃣ 🔄 Data Cleaning & Structuring

Job roles had a large number of variations → Simplified into broader categories like "Other".
Favorite programming languages also had inconsistent naming → Grouped into common categories.

2️⃣ 💰 Salary Column Handling

Yearly salaries were provided as ranges (e.g., 30K-40K).

Extracted min & max values, created separate columns, and calculated the average salary.

3️⃣ 📊 Choosing the Right Visualization

Categorical columns (Job roles, favorite programming language) → Pie charts / Donut charts

Salary distribution → Bar charts & Box plots

Country-wise salary trends → Map visualizations

📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard

📌 Salary Trends

💰 Data Scientists earn the highest salaries, followed by Data Engineers and Data Architects.

🌎 Country-wise Salary Insights:

🇺🇸 USA has the highest average salary.

🇮🇳 India has the lowest average salary, but cost of living plays a major role in salary structures.

Salary variations depend on economic factors in different regions.

📌 Education & Career Insights

🎓 PhD is not necessary to enter the data industry! Bachelor’s & Master’s degrees are sufficient.

🧑‍💻 Python is the most preferred programming language – No surprises there!

📌 Industry Sentiment

Despite high salaries, many data professionals are not completely satisfied with their earnings.
