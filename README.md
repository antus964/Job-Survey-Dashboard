# 🔍 Key Focus Areas:    
    
✔️ Data cleaning & transformation using PowerQuery  
✔️ Effective data visualization techniques
✔️ Extracting insights on salary trends, job roles & education 

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

📊 Power BI – For interactive dashboard creation

🏗 Power Query Editor – For data transformation

📄 Microsoft Excel – Data preprocessing

# ⚡ Challenges Faced & Solutions

1️⃣ 🔄 Data Cleaning & Structuring

Job roles had a large number of variations → Simplified into broader categories like "Other".
Favorite programming languages also had inconsistent naming → Grouped into common categories.

2️⃣ 💰 Salary Column Handling

Yearly salaries were provided as ranges (e.g., 30K-40K).

Extracted min & max values, created separate columns, and calculated the average salary.

3️⃣ 📊 Choosing the Right Visualization

Categorical columns (Job roles, favorite programming language) → Pie charts / Donut charts

Salary distribution → Bar charts & Box plots

Country-wise salary trends → Map visualizations

# 📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard

📌 Salary Trends

💰 Data Scientists earn the highest salaries, followed by Data Engineers and Data Architects.

🌎 Country-wise Salary Insights:

🇺🇸 USA has the highest average salary.

🇮🇳 India has the lowest average salary, but cost of living plays a major role in salary structures.

Salary variations depend on economic factors in different regions

# 📌 Education & Career Insights

🎓 PhD is not necessary to enter the data industry! Bachelor’s & Master’s degrees are sufficient.

🧑‍💻 Python is the most preferred programming language – No surprises there!

📌 Industry Sentiment

Despite high salaries, many data professionals are not completely satisfied with their earnings.
